# JavaTeX

LaTeX document generator for creating tests/quizzes, examples, answer keys, etc., using the Swing package for graphics.

## Installation

As of right now, this software is still a WIP. When the graphical interface is linked, and PDF generation is automated, a first release will become available for anyone to try out.

As progress is made, more presets and customizability will become available.
